### Source Code

```
I have personally tested the ActiveX Control PBBalloon 1.2 from PABLOB.NET and I am really impressed!, using it, I was able to create Balloon Messages like the ones in Windows XP under Windows 95, and with features I’ve never seen, like Links and Buttons in the Balloons and the possibility to change the Balloon Text, Font and Colors while the Balloon is visible, That allows you to create cool Effects like the ones found in an example included in their download.
I have test it under Visual Basic 6, Visual Basic.NET, Visual C++ 6.0 and Office Applications without any problem at all.
I really recommend it!
